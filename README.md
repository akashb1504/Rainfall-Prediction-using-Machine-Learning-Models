# 🌧 Rainfall Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview

- Preprocesses weather dataset (cleaning, feature scaling,balanced using **Random Over Sampling**, train-test split).  
- Trains and evaluates multiple ML models.  
- Uses **accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report** for evaluation.  
- Visualizes model comparison using a bar chart of accuracy scores.

- Random Forest Classifier  
- XGBoost Classifier  
- Logistic Regression  

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy Score  
- Confusion Matrix  
- Classification Report
